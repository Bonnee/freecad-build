Builds FreeCAD [LinkDaily](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/tree/LinkDaily) branch in an Arch Linux container and publishes the built binaries on the AUR.

# Where
The built archive resides as a release asset. Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Bonnee/freecad-build-arch/releases) page. The [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/freecad-linkstage3-bin) is published automatically after each successful build

Why waste free computing resources?
