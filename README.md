# freecad-build-arch
Builds FreeCAD [LinkDaily](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/tree/LinkDaily) branch with [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Makepkg).

# Where
Built packages reside as artifacts of a build job. Head over to the [Actions](https://github.com/Bonnee/freecad-build-arch/actions) page.

# Why
Because GitHub gives me 50 hours of Actions for free and I don't want to waste them.
